Spam Detection using Naive Bayes
This project implements a spam detection system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It classifies email or message text as either spam or ham using TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. The model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics on a dataset (mail_data.csv) containing labeled messages.
